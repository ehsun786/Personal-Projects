# Sprint Retrospective

What should we stop doing?

- Leaving off tasks too close to the deadlne

- Working seperately from another when working on the project in the labs

- Leaving updates to appropriate documents last minute (eg product backlog, architecture design)

- Stop pushing code straight to main

What should we continue?

- The continued communication on the chat is fine, problems are being reported though slight improvement in reporting progress is needed

- The regularity of meetings is fine

- Keep learning new tech appropriate to project

What should we start doing?

- Testers need to work more closely with the rest of the programmers so they are aware of the state of the system as well how featuers were implemented, hence testing can be done quicker.

- If we are experiencing a problem we need to communicate to the chat more or message individuals who can specifically help

- Learning new technologies at a quicker pace and in advance, this way implementation speed will increase.

- Testers need to learn how to create extensive gherkin scenarios as well as testing in cucumber.

- Focus one one or two features at a time rather than planning for the next 10 or so

- Utilise pull requests when approriate.

## Role Descriptions

- dq13 - My role as a Back-End Developer will be to work with technologies such as JPA, Hibernate, SQL, and follow the MVC framework in order to make sure that connection between the user interface and the database is maintained. In addition to this, I will be ensuring the communication is secure using Spring Security. I will also be heavily involved in the design decisions made such as the Class Diagram, structure of code, and developing algorithms which solve problems. At the early stages of the project I will be gathering requirements and assisting with documentation such as the Risk Log.

- emh26 - I have chosen to be the Backend Developer and the Support Programmer for this project. My role as a Backend Developer will be to use web technologies like Spring MVC, JPA and Hibernate to design the business logic of the system. Having used these technologies before, I think that this would be a great opportunity to enhance my current capabilities. As a technical author I will be discussing technical issues with managers(FDM), developers in the team, and will be working closely with another team member to design the requirements of the system.

- aw373 - As a Tester, my job is to be mainly responsible for the manual testing of the system by documenting it and also developing automated tests. This will include writing gherkin scenarios and testing with cucumber. I am more focused towards the end of the project when the system has been completed, but development of automated testing can begin just before that. I am able to assist on smaller scale tasks during the early stages such as the risk log and voicing issues during meetings.

- cy68 - As a supporting Tester and one of the Requirements Analyst, I will be responsible for analysing the specific requirements of the worksheet and doing testing. A better understanding of the requirements will be helpful for my group to deliver the features that are required to a high standard. I will contact the group with anything that is required from my analysis of the requirements. Iâ€™ll be in contact with other testers to ensure that the tests that we run will ensure that the features are functional.

- cw374 - As a front-end developer, I will be responsible for client-side development using technologies such as HTML and JavaScript. I will likely use CSS to give a harmonious look and feel to the website i.e. a style that is consistent throughout. JavaScript will be used to program the behaviour of the web-pages. As a group we will be discussing the design considerations for the front-end of the application: it's appearance and behaviour/presence of elements on web-pages and this will guide the front end development.

- ch388 - I will be predominantly working with build managing as it is something I am more familiar with. I have used Travis and spent a significant amount of time on the last project getting all types of checking tools to work. This time with more web based development instead of just Java, I look to expand my understanding and figure out how I can apply checks and tests in slightly different situations. I will also be supporting in the front end developing as opposed to the back end because Spring MVC and testing was my weakest part. I understand HTML and have some ideas of what kind of designs we could use for our online course. 

- cfn2 - My role is Requirements Analyst and Supporting Tester. It is very common for groups to lose significant marks because they have not read, or applied the guideline for the project clearly. As a Requirements Analyst, I am responsible for reviewing the work of the others to ensure it meets the requirements. As a supporting Tester, my job is focusing on testing the system  mainly, using gherkin and cucumber. I will keep in touch with other testers to ensure the features of the program are functional.

- br98 - My role as Scrum Master is to be responsible for managing and arranging meetings, keeping track of progress through updating the minutes and project backlog, and helping the team reach a consensus on what can be done in each sprint and meeting. As a back-end developer I will be heavily involved in designing and developing the algorithms, general structure of the code, and creating the database and security layers. As a Technical Author I will be deconstructing and communicating the technical aspects/issues of the project to the rest of the team.

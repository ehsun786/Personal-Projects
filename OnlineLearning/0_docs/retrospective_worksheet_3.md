# Sprint 3 Retrospective


What should we stop doing?

- Leaving off tasks too close to the deadline

- Working seperately from one another when working on the project in the labs and not contacting other members of the group when not in the labs.

- Front end developers doing very little or close to nothing.

- Group members should stop being unclear about the deadlines they set for completing a piece of work and then not completing it too.

- Leaving research late in the development cycle

- We should stop giving ourselves roles we are not capable of handling.

What should we continue?

- We should continue to notify everyone with the progress of developing the web application.

- We should continue the search and application for new technologies to use for developing the project.

What should we start doing?

- We should continue to take initiative and actively complete pre-planned work.

- Learning new technologies at a quicker pace.

- Testers need to learn how to create extensive gherkin scenarios as well as testing in cucumber.

- Testers also need to understand the concepts behind implementing penetration testing as well as cross browser testing.

- The scrum master should be learn how to organise and keep up with basic documentation like the backlog and risk log.

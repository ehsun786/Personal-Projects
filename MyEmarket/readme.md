# CO2006 MINI-PROJECT 16-17: eMarket (a solution)

## Features and productivity tips (optional)

In this solution I have used a couple of features that streamline the use of Java for developing web applications:
* [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): for removing some of the verbosity of Java programs
* Hot swapping: for quickly redeploying Java apps

### Project Lombok

* To use Lombok from the STS, you will first need to install it. Thankfully there is a gradle plugin for this.
* Add the following code to your gradle build script

	// used to install lombok
	plugins {
		id 'io.franzbecker.gradle-lombok' version '1.7'
		id 'java'
	}
	// the following code may be included in your script already!
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}

* Execute `./gradlew intallLombok`. This will run an installation wizard that will ask your for your IDE installation location.
* Choose the `.ini` file inside `<STS folder>/eclipse/`
* Remove the following code from the gradle build script:

	// used to install lombok
	plugins {
		id 'io.franzbecker.gradle-lombok' version '1.7'
		id 'java'
	}
	
* Add the [dependency to the Lombok jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok) in each project where you would like to use it. For example: 

	compile group: 'org.projectlombok', name: 'lombok', version: '1.16.10'

* [Check Lombok's features](https://projectlombok.org/features/index.html) for learning about what you can do in Java now. 

### Hot swapping

When developing a web application, applying changes and redeploying the application can be quite time consuming. There are two approaches to speed up this process:
- [application restart](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-hotswapping.html#howto-reload-fast-restart): fast application restart by reusing the class loader that is used to load your Java classes
- [dynamic class reloading](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-hotswapping.html#howto-reload-java-classes-without-restarting): modified classes are reloaded at a much finer granularity level 

We are going to focus on dynamic class reloading.

#### Dynamic class reloading

##### From STS
* Download the jar file from [https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-loaded](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-loaded) and copy it in the root folder of the project 
* Right-click on project: `Run as...Run configurations`
* Create a new Spring Boot launch configuration and append `-javaagent:springloaded-1.2.5.RELEASE.jar -noverify` in the Arguments tab (field VM arguments)
* Run your web application as a Spring Boot application from the IDE and whenever there is a change in a class, the changes will be reloaded automatically (this may still take a fraction of the time used for rebooting the application). 


##### From Gradle

Add the following code to your Gradle build script: 

	buildscript {
	    ext {
	        springBootVersion = '1.4.0.RELEASE'
	    }
	    repositories {
	        mavenCentral()
	    }
	    dependencies {
	        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springBootVersion}") 
			classpath("org.springframework:springloaded:1.2.5.RELEASE")
	    }
	}

Reloading classes using Gradle involves creating two processes: 
* one that runs a continuous build that will compile classes whenever there is a change using `./gradlew -t classes`
* a normal build that runs the web app using: `./gradlew bootRun`


#### Restarting

#####Â From Gradle

Add the following dependency: `compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools:${springBootVersion}")`

Restarting the application using Gradle involves creating two processes: 
* one that runs a continuous build that will compile classes whenever there is a change using `./gradlew -t classes`
* a normal build that runs the web app using: `./gradlew bootRun`

This time, whenever there is a change in a class in the classpath of the project, the application will restart without changing the contextual libraries that have been loaded already.
 
### Reuse of CSS and Javascript libraries

You can use many CSS and javascript libraries for your designing web application by using [webjars](http://www.webjars.org/). In this example, we have used Bootstrap to draw links as buttons. To use a webjar, follow these steps:

* Add the dependency to the webjar as you would do with any Java dependency:

		compile("org.webjars:bootstrap:3.3.7")
	
* To use this dependency in a web page, use the prefix `webjars/bootstrap/3.3.7/`. For example, to use a particular CSS stylesheet, add: 

		<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="webjars/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
